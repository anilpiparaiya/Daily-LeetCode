# LeetCode-Daily-Challenges
Daily Challenges to refresh my streak!


How do I determine if today was productive or not ?


I have some clear objectives which I would love to achieve on a daily basis

- Workout for 45 minutes
- Clean eating throughout the day
- Reading Book for 20 mins
- Accomplish daily goals in work (I set them a night before)
- Meditate in morning for 15 mins
- Sleep for 7-8 hours


but the sad part is I am not Superman, so to call my day a productive I try to accomplish minimum 4 out of 6 things mentioned above.

Then, every week I try to beat my number of productive days.
